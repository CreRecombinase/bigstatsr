## This is a resubmission. In this version,
* I've removed all the NOTEs I could.
* I've given some examples of the statistical tools that are provided even if a full list of the features of this package has already been provided in the README file.
* I've mentionned that there is a scientific paper in preparation associated with this package (not yet submitted, not even to bioRxiv).
* I've removed the double space in the description. 
* I've removed the Remotes field from the DESCRIPTION file.
* I've reduced some tolerances of tests.
* I've incremented the package version.

There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs. 

Overall, there were 2 NOTEs:

* checking installed package size ... NOTE

* checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... NOTE
  Maintainer: 'Florian PrivÃ© <florian.prive.21@gmail.com>'
  New submission
  
  I don't understand this NOTE because I have another package on CRAN (https://cran.r-project.org/package=primefactr).
