## R CMD check results

Overall, there were no ERROR, 1 WARNING and 2 NOTEs:

* Found the following significant warnings:
  d:/RCompile/CRANpkg/lib/3.6/BH/include/boost/interprocess/detail/win32_api.hpp:145:9: warning: ISO C++ prohibits anonymous structs [-Wpedantic]
  d:/RCompile/CRANpkg/lib/3.6/BH/include/boost/interprocess/detail/win32_api.hpp:153:9: warning: ISO C++ prohibits anonymous structs [-Wpedantic]

  d:/RCompile/CRANpkg/lib/3.6/BH/include/boost/interprocess/detail/win32_api.hpp:180:7: warning: ISO C++ prohibits anonymous structs [-Wpedantic]
  
-> Package BH comes with these issues on 'r-devel-windows-ix86+x86_64' only. 
   This is also the case for many other packages (e.g. package bigmemory) and should be fixed in the next version of package BH.

  It tried to write in the installed package's location.
